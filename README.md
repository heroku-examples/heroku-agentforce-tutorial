Creating Agentforce Custom Actions with Heroku
==============================================

This tutorial will guide you through configuring an Agentforce Action deployed to Heroku within your Salesforce org. This allows Agentforce agents to access powerful custom-coded actions written in Python and other languages, leveraging Heroku's fully managed and elastic compute service. By the end, you will be able to generate your own badge as shown below!

Step 1 - Deploy to Heroku
-------------------------

This tutorial provides examples in Java and Python for coding a basic Agentforce action. Complete the standard Heroku deployment instructions in one of the following repositories before progressing to the next step.

| Language | GitHub Repository
| -------- | ---------------
| Python | [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/heroku-examples/heroku-agentforce-tutorial-python)
| Java | [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/heroku-examples/heroku-agentforce-tutorial-java)

Step 2 - Publishing your Heroku App into a Salesforce org
---------------------------------------------------------

> ðŸ’¡ **Salesforce Org Requirements:**<br/>Ensure you have access to Agentforce in your org by searching for `Agents` in the `Setup` menu. If not, you can obtain a free [Salesforce Developer Edition org here](https://www.salesforce.com/form/developer-signup/?d=pb). Be sure to visit `Einstein Setup` to enable Einstein, the fresh the page and search for `Agentforce Agents` to enable Agentforce. Finally on the same page click `Enable the Agentforce (Default) Agent`.

From the directory you completed the above deployment in, run the following commands.

Add the Heroku Integration add-on to your application.

```
heroku addons:create heroku-applink
```

Configure the application ID as follows:

```
heroku config:set HEROKU_APP_ID="$(heroku apps:info --json | jq -r '.app.id')"
```

> ðŸ’¡ **jq utility:**<br/>If you do not have the `jq` utlity, run `heroku apps:info --json` manually and extract the value from the `app` json structure output to the console.

Connect your Heroku application to the org you intend to configure Agentforce within.

```
heroku salesforce:connect my-org
```

Add the Heroku Integration Service Mesh buildpack to ensure incoming calls from the Salesforce org are authenticated correctly.

```
$ heroku buildpacks:add https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-heroku-applink-service-mesh
```

Import your applications and its API specification into the connected org, for Python use `api-spec.json`.

```
heroku salesforce:publish api-spec.yaml --client-name BadgeService --connection-name my-org --authorization-connected-app-name BadgeServiceConnectedApp --authorization-permission-set-name BadgeServicePermissions
```

Lastly trigger a redeploy of the application to ensure the service mesh is running using the following commands.

```
git commit --allow-empty -m "empty commit"
git push heroku main
```

Once complete check your application has been imported by searching for **Heroku** and then **Apps** under the **Setup** menu in your org.

Step 3 - Assigning Permissions
------------------------------

The above process created `BadgeService` and `BadgeServicePermissions` permission sets to control access to your application from within the org. Search for **Permisison Sets** under **Setup**, locate these permission sets and click **Manage Assignments** to assign to your user.

Step 4 - Creating an Agentforce Action
--------------------------------------

1. Search for `Agent Assets` under the `Setup` menu, and on the `Actions` tab, click `New Agent Action`, selecting `API` as the `Reference Action Type`. Then select `Heroku` from the `Reference Action Category`. In the `Reference Action` search field, search for `Generate Badge`. Your dialog should look like the following:

Step 5 - Using Agent Builder
----------------------------

1. Search for `Agentforce Agents` under `Setup`.

2. Click the `Agentforce (Default)` link at the bottom of the page to find the `Open in Agent Builder` button.

3. Click the `Deactivate` button in the top right of the screen if present.

4. Click `Topics` and the `General CRM` topic. If the `New Version` button is shown, click it.

5. Click the `Topic Configuration` tab and append "***Also including requests for badges.***" to the current contents of the `Classification Description` field. Click `Save`.

7. Finally, click the `Activate` button in the top right of the screen.

Step 6 - Testing your Action
----------------------------

1. Open the `Agent Builder` for `Einstein Copilot`.

2. In the `Conversation Preview`, enter `Generate a badge for Astro`

    > You can, of course, change the name to your own and share your badge with your friends!
