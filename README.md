Step 1 - Obtaining a Action API URL for a deployed Heroku Agent Action
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This tutorial provides examples in Java and Python on how to code a basic Agentforce action. You can deploy these to your own Heroku account or proceed for now with the predeployed versions we have created for you. Review the table below to locate the code and predeployed URL's.

| Language | Predeployed API URL | Predployed API Test Page | Or.. Deploy your Own to Heroku
| -------- | --------------- | ------------------- | -----------
| Python | [Action API URL](x) | [Action API Test Page](x) | Go to this [GitHub Repository]()
| Java | [Action API URL](x) | [Action API Test Page](x) | Go to this [GitHub Repository]()

If you are using the predeployed versions, right click the ***Action API URL*** link from above (language choice does not really matter in this case) and copy to the URL to your clipboard when requested. You may also clck the ***Action API Test URL*** to try out from your browser the action API that Agentforce will eventually callout to. Otherwise follow the instructions in the respective repository above and return here with the deployed URL.
